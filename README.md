# Safe Return

A "dead-man's switch" that can help alert authorities in case of the user being in danger. 
It analyses the user's location, and if they are not at their set home at a set time, it will run a shortcut.

## Caveats
- Currently, the app will only work if foregrounded. We strongly reccomend using guided access if trying to use the app
- The app only works on IOS so far. Android support will come
